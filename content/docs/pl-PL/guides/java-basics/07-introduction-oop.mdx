title: 07 - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
description: Learn the fundamentals of classes and objects in Java.
---

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the foundation of Java and Hytale modding. Instead of just having variables and methods floating around, we organize them into **classes** and **objects**.

## What is a Class?

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Think of it like a recipe or a template.

```java
```

## What is an Object?

An object is an instance created from a class. If a class is a blueprint, an object is the actual thing built from that blueprint.

```java
```

<Callout type="info" title="Class vs Object">
  **Class** = Blueprint (the idea of a player)
  **Object** = Actual thing (Alice, Bob, specific players)

  One class can create many objects, just like one recipe can make many cakes!
</Callout>

## Creating a Simple Class

Let's create a `Sword` class for Hytale:

```java
```

Using the class:

```java
```

## Constructors

Instead of setting properties one by one, use a **constructor** to initialize objects:

```java
```

Now creating swords is easier:

```java
```

<Callout type="info" title="Constructor Rules">
  * Same name as the class
  * No return type (not even `void`)
  * Called automatically when you use `new`
  * Can have multiple constructors (overloading)

  ```java
  ```
</Callout>

## The `this` Keyword

`this` refers to the current object. Use it to clarify when parameter names match property names:

```java
```

Without `this`, Java gets confused:

```java
```

## Practical Examples

### Item Class

```java
```

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Item potion = new Item("Health Potion", "Consumable", 5, 0.5);
        
        potion.use();  // Used Health Potion. Remaining: 4
        System.out.println("Total weight: " + potion.getTotalWeight()); // 2.0
    }
}
```

### Monster Class

```java
```

```java
```

### Block Class

```java
```

## Access Modifiers (Preview)

You've seen `public` - it means "anyone can access this". We'll learn more about access control later, but here's a preview:

```java
```

For now, use `public` for everything. We'll learn when to use `private` in the next article.

<Callout type="info" title="Why Use Classes?">
  Classes help you:

  * **Organize** related data and methods together
  * **Reuse** code easily (create many objects from one class)
  * **Model** real-world things (players, items, monsters)
  * **Maintain** code (changes in one place affect all objects)

  Without classes, managing 100 players would require 100 separate variables for each property. With classes, it's just 100 Player objects!
</Callout>

## Practice Exercises

1. **Create a `Potion` Class**:
   * Properties: name, healAmount, uses
   * Constructor to set all properties
   * Method `drink()` that heals and decreases uses
   * Method `isEmpty()` that returns true if uses less than or equal to 0

2. **Create a `Chest` Class**:
   * Properties: isLocked, itemCount, capacity
   * Constructor
   * Method `addItem()` that checks capacity
   * Method `unlock()` that sets isLocked to false
   * Method `isFull()` that checks if itemCount >= capacity

3. **Create a `Villager` Class**:
   * Properties: name, profession, tradeCount
   * Constructor
   * Method `greet()` that prints a greeting
   * Method `trade()` that increases tradeCount
   * Method `getInfo()` that displays all properties

4. **Create Multiple Objects**: Using any class you made, create 3 different objects and test all their methods.
